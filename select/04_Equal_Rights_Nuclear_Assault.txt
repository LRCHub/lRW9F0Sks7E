Prejudice is just another way of saying ignorant
Describing morons narrow mind and losers bloody frozen hearts
People who can't see past skin or see what's a good man's head
Closed up thinking backwards mind all thought paralyzed
Using any argument cause you don't want to use your head
Keeping evil ways alive even though they should have died
Freedom is a human right skin don't matter black or white

Equal Rights, Human Rights

Martin Luther a great man who wanted people to be sane
Killed by frightened ignorance even though it was too late
His message seems to be quite clear, why should we be ruled by fear
With his death a great man died but you can't kill his ideals
Let us leave behind us all these stupid racial arguments
Help make racial wars a distant unforgotten memory
Maybe hate will never die that doesn't mean we shouldn't try

Equal Rights, Human Rights

Prejudice is just another way of saying ignorant
Describing morons narrow mind and losers bloody frozen hearts
People who can't see past skin or see what's a good man's head
Closed up thinking backwards mind all thought paralyzed
Using any argument cause you don't want to use your head
Keeping evil ways alive even though they should have died
Freedom is a human right skin don't matter black or white
