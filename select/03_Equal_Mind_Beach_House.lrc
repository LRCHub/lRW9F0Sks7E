[00:27.69] A silhouette that comes to me
[00:33.17] As your state of infinity
[00:38.75] Even in your equal mind
[00:44.08] You were passing through this time
[01:01.08] 
[00:49.84] Delicate with no defense
[00:55.12] Honor what you love to no end
[01:00.52] Perfection in the accident
[01:06.18] Truly yours is just what I meant
[01:22.18] 
[01:13.37] Equal Mind
[01:18.84] Equal Mind
[01:24.26] Equal Mind
[01:29.26] 
[02:04.75] There is no way you could know
[02:10.04] These waves they come and they go
[02:15.41] In blooms they're chasing the lights
[02:21.06] Too soon they say these goodbyes
[02:37.06] 
[02:25.61] Equal Mind
[02:30.48] Equal Mind
[02:35.93] Equal Mind
[02:40.93] 
[03:07.38] Equal Mind
